# Architecture

`to` has two runtime pieces:

- `bin/to`: a zsh wrapper used before shell integration. It prints the init
  script and can run non-jump commands such as `--doctor`, `--reindex`,
  `roots`, and `--version`.
- `to.plugin.zsh`: the shell integration. It defines the `to` function that can
  change the current shell's working directory.

The Rust binary, `to-helper`, is an optional accelerator for SQLite queries. The
zsh implementation remains the source of truth so the tool can fall back to
plain `sqlite3`, TSV files, `fd`, or `find`.

## Data flow

```text
query
  -> built-in aliases
  -> user aliases
  -> workspaces
  -> frecency history
  -> SQLite directory/file/repository index
  -> TSV fallback
  -> live fd/find search
  -> interactive selection when needed
  -> cd
  -> recent/frecency/index/stat bookkeeping
```

## Persistent state

By default, all state lives under `~/.config/to`:

- `roots`: configured search roots.
- `index.sqlite3`: primary index when SQLite is available.
- `index.tsv`: fallback index when SQLite is unavailable.
- `aliases`: text fallback for user aliases.
- `workspaces`: text fallback for workspaces.
- `recent`: text fallback for recent destinations.

The SQLite database also owns frecency and runtime-diagnostic state:

- `history(path, visits, last_used)`: successful jumps update one row.
- `files(path, name, stem, parent, depth, last_seen)`: file-name cache populated
  on demand.
- `stats(key, value)`: last search outcome, hit counters, and last reindex.
- `dirs.repo` and `dirs.repo_name`: Git repository metadata populated during
  reindex and live repo fallback.

Queries use history before the directory index when `TO_FRECENCY=1`, then fall
back to index and live discovery if no history score reaches
`TO_FRECENCY_THRESHOLD`.

`TO_CONFIG_HOME` can move this state directory.

## Current module boundaries

`to.plugin.zsh` is intentionally still a single shipped file. That keeps
Homebrew installation and `eval "$(to init zsh)"` simple, but the file has clear
internal areas:

1. Config defaults and path expansion.
2. Root, alias, workspace, recent, frecency, and runtime-stat state.
3. SQLite schema and migration.
4. Index collection, refresh, pruning, and query.
5. Matching and ranking.
6. Interactive selection.
7. Watcher and doctor commands.
8. Public `to` command dispatch.

## Refactor plan

If the plugin is split later, keep the installed public surface unchanged:

- `bin/to` must still print one sourceable entrypoint.
- Homebrew should still install the plugin under `share/to`.
- Direct source installs should still work from a single documented directory.
- Tests must continue to drive the public `to` function rather than private
  helper files.

The safest split order is:

1. Move SQLite/index helpers into a sourced `index.zsh`.
2. Move state helpers into a sourced `state.zsh`.
3. Move matching/selection helpers into a sourced `match.zsh`.
4. Keep command dispatch in `to.plugin.zsh`.

Each split should preserve function names until the test suite has equivalent
coverage for the new boundary.
