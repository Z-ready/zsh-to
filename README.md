# to

`to` is an **exploratory directory jumper for zsh**.

It helps you jump to local folders by name, path fragment, keyword, workspace,
alias, recent destination, or Git repository.

```zsh
to backend
to src/components
to app backend
to repo nginx
```

zoxide optimizes history: it gets better after you visit directories.
`to` optimizes discovery: it indexes configured roots and finds matching
folders even if you have never visited them before.

## Getting Started

Install `to`:

```zsh
brew tap Z-ready/zsh-to https://github.com/Z-ready/zsh-to
brew trust --formula z-ready/zsh-to/to
brew install to
```

Add this to the end of `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
eval "$(to init zsh)"
```

Reload zsh:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

By default, `to` searches your home directory. Add focused roots only when you
keep work outside your home directory or want a narrower setup:

```zsh
to use /path/to/a/root
```

Warm the index when you want faster first searches:

```zsh
to --reindex
```

Jump:

```zsh
to backend
```

If you create a new directory after indexing, `to` can still find it on the
first query through live `fd`/`find` fallback and cache it for later:

```zsh
mkdir -p ~/somewhere/new-service
to new-service
```

You can also jump by file name. `to` searches for the file on demand and jumps
to the directory that contains it:

```zsh
to package.json
```

Check the installed version:

```zsh
to --version
```

## Installation

`to` can be installed with Homebrew.

### 1. Install `to`

```zsh
brew tap Z-ready/zsh-to https://github.com/Z-ready/zsh-to
brew trust --formula z-ready/zsh-to/to
brew install to
```

Homebrew installs the full runtime environment:

| Dependency | Why it is installed |
| --- | --- |
| `fd` | Fast filesystem discovery |
| `fzf` | Interactive result selection |
| `sqlite` | Index, aliases, workspaces, recent entries, ranking data |
| `fswatch` | Optional filesystem watching on macOS |
| `inotify-tools` | Optional filesystem watching on Linux |
| `rust` | Build-time only, used to compile `to-helper` |

### 2. Set up zsh

Add this to `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
eval "$(to init zsh)"
```

This loads the zsh function that performs the final `cd`.

If you prefer direct sourcing:

```zsh
source "$(brew --prefix to)/share/to/to.plugin.zsh"
```

### 3. Optional: rebuild zsh completions

Homebrew installs zsh completions. If completions do not appear:

```zsh
rm -f ~/.zcompdump*
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```

### 4. Source install

Homebrew is the recommended install path. For a manual source install:

Install build and runtime dependencies first:

```zsh
# macOS
brew install rust fd fzf sqlite zsh fswatch
```

```sh
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git zsh cargo fd-find fzf sqlite3 inotify-tools
sudo ln -sf "$(command -v fdfind)" /usr/local/bin/fd
```

`git`, `zsh`, and Rust/Cargo are required to build and load `to`. `fd`, `fzf`,
`sqlite3`, and a watcher (`fswatch` on macOS, `inotifywait` from
`inotify-tools` on Linux) provide the full runtime experience.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Z-ready/zsh-to.git
cd zsh-to
cargo build --release

install -d ~/.local/bin ~/.local/share/to ~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions
install -m 755 bin/to ~/.local/bin/to
install -m 755 target/release/to-helper ~/.local/bin/to-helper
install -m 644 to.plugin.zsh ~/.local/share/to/to.plugin.zsh
install -m 644 completions/_to ~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions/_to
```

Then make sure `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH` and add the normal zsh setup:

```zsh
eval "$(to init zsh)"
```

Manual installs can also source the plugin directly:

```zsh
source ~/.local/share/to/to.plugin.zsh
```

If you want completions from a manual install, make sure the completion
directory is in `fpath` before `compinit`:

```zsh
fpath=("$HOME/.local/share/zsh/site-functions" $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```

### 5. Configure roots

`to` searches configured roots. On first load, the default root is your home
directory:

```text
~
```

Home-first discovery means any directory under your home directory can be
valid. `to` does not assume names such as `Projects`, `Code`, `workspace`, or
anything author-specific. It still avoids common heavy or noisy directories
through `TO_EXCLUDES`, limits scan depth with `TO_MAX_DEPTH`, and does not
follow symlinked directory trees unless you opt in.

Add extra roots when you keep files outside your home directory:

```zsh
to use /Volumes/Media
to use /work
to roots
```

Search outside your saved roots without changing config:

```zsh
to -r /mnt/data/projects backend
```

Remove roots you no longer want:

```zsh
to unuse /Volumes/Media
```

If your home directory is too large, switch to explicit-root mode and list only
the roots you want searched:

```zsh
TO_ROOT_MODE=explicit
TO_ROOTS=(
  "$HOME/src"
  "/Volumes/Work"
)
```

## Usage

### Basic jumps

Jump to a directory by exact name:

```zsh
to backend
```

Jump by path fragment:

```zsh
to src/components
```

Jump by multiple keywords:

```zsh
to app backend
```

Jump to the directory containing a file:

```zsh
to Cargo.toml
to package.json
```

Force interactive selection:

```zsh
to -i backend
```

Temporarily search from one root:

```zsh
to -r /path/to/root backend
to --from /path/to/root backend
```

### Built-in aliases

These aliases work when the target directories exist:

```text
download / downloads -> ~/Downloads
desktop              -> ~/Desktop
document/documents   -> ~/Documents
```

Example:

```zsh
to download
```

### User aliases

Add an alias:

```zsh
to add blog ~/Documents/obsidian/blog
```

Use it:

```zsh
to blog
```

List aliases:

```zsh
to aliases
```

Remove an alias:

```zsh
to remove blog
```

### Search roots

`to` has two discovery modes:

- `TO_ROOT_MODE=home` (default): search `$HOME` plus configured roots.
- `TO_ROOT_MODE=explicit`: search only configured roots.

Home-first mode is intentionally layout-agnostic. You do not need to teach
`to` whether you keep code, notes, media, or work trees under any particular
folder name.

Add the current directory:

```zsh
to use .
```

Add a specific directory:

```zsh
to use /path/to/a/root
```

List roots:

```zsh
to roots
```

Remove a root:

```zsh
to unuse /path/to/a/root
```

If you want a narrower setup for a very large home directory, set
`TO_ROOT_MODE=explicit`, define `TO_ROOTS`, and lower `TO_MAX_DEPTH`.

When a temporary `to -r <root> <query>` search finds a directory outside your
saved roots, `to` tells you which parent to add. Set `TO_AUTO_ADD_ROOTS=1` if
you want those temporary-search parent roots added automatically after a
successful jump. `to` refuses broad system roots such as `/`, `/System`, and
`/usr`; add a narrower directory that contains the places you actually jump to.

### Workspaces

Workspaces are named destinations:

```zsh
to workspace work /path/to/work
to work work
```

List workspaces:

```zsh
to workspaces
```

Remove a workspace:

```zsh
to unwork work
```

### Git repositories

Jump to an indexed Git repository:

```zsh
to repo nginx
```

`to` detects `.git` directories during indexing and stores that metadata in
SQLite, so `to repo <query>` does not need to inspect every candidate live.

### Recent destinations

Jump from recent successful destinations:

```zsh
to recent
```

### AI hooks

`to` does not bundle a hosted AI model. It provides hooks for users who want
to connect their own local or remote ranker.

Use broad AI-style fallback search:

```zsh
to ai docker
```

Set `TO_AI_COMMAND` to provide candidates for `to ai <query...>`.
Set `TO_AI_RANK_COMMAND` to reorder normal fallback candidates from stdin.
These hooks execute commands you configure yourself. Treat them like shell
aliases: only point them at scripts you trust.

## Command Reference

```zsh
to <query...>             # search and cd to a matching directory
to -i <query...>          # force interactive selection
to -r <root> <query...>   # temporarily search from one root
to --from <root> <query>  # same as -r

to use .                  # add the current directory as a search root
to use /path/to/root      # add a specific search root
to unuse /path/to/root    # remove a search root
to roots                  # list search roots

to add blog ~/Notes/blog  # add a user alias
to remove blog            # remove a user alias
to aliases                # list user aliases

to workspace work /path/to/work  # add a workspace
to work work              # jump to a workspace
to unwork work            # remove a workspace
to workspaces             # list workspaces

to repo nginx             # jump to a matching Git repository
to recent                 # jump from recent destinations
to ai docker              # use TO_AI_COMMAND, or broad fallback search

to init zsh               # print zsh integration script
to --reindex              # refresh the SQLite/TSV directory index
to --watch                # watch roots and reindex after filesystem changes
to --doctor               # check dependencies and config
to --version              # show version
```

`to init zsh`, `to --doctor`, `to --reindex`, `to --watch`, `to --version`,
and state-management commands such as `to roots` can run from the installed
`bin/to` wrapper. Directory jumps require shell integration because only a zsh
function can change the current shell's working directory.

When multiple matches are found, `to` opens `fzf`. If `fzf` is unavailable, it
prints a numbered list.

## Matching

Resolution order:

1. Built-in aliases.
2. User aliases.
3. Workspaces.
4. SQLite exact-name matches.
5. SQLite Git repo matches.
6. SQLite token matches for multi-word queries.
7. SQLite path-fragment matches.
8. Live directory discovery with `fd`, with `find` fallback.
9. Exact file-name discovery, jumping to the containing directory.

Exact directory names win for plain single-word queries:

```zsh
to assignment
```

If `~/Downloads/Assignment` exists, `to assignment` jumps there instead of
listing every child directory below it.

Path fragments work when the query contains a slash:

```zsh
to src/components
```

Multi-word queries require every token to appear somewhere in the path:

```zsh
to app backend
```

File-name jumps are exact-name, on-demand searches:

```zsh
to pyproject.toml
to README.md
```

If multiple directories contain the same file name, `to` prefers the directory
you used most recently, then the one you use most often. File names are not
stored in the main index; the containing directory is cached after a successful
jump.

Plain single-word path-fragment matching is disabled by default. Enable it
only if you want broader results:

```zsh
TO_SEARCH_PATH_FRAGMENTS=1
```

## Configuration

Configuration is loaded from:

```zsh
~/.config/to/config.zsh
```

Example:

```zsh
TO_ROOTS=(
  "$HOME/src"
  "/Volumes/Work"
)

TO_EXCLUDES=(
  ".git"
  "node_modules"
  "target"
  ".venv"
  "Library"
)

TO_MAX_DEPTH=8
TO_INTERACTIVE_THRESHOLD=3
TO_SEARCH_PATH_FRAGMENTS=0
TO_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS=0
TO_ROOT_MODE=home
TO_WATCH_DEBOUNCE=2
TO_AUTOWATCH=0
TO_AUTO_ADD_ROOTS=0
TO_AI_COMMAND=""
TO_AI_RANK_COMMAND=""
TO_HELPER=""
```

Options:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TO_MAX_DEPTH` | `8` | Maximum scan depth per root |
| `TO_INTERACTIVE_THRESHOLD` | `3` | Result count where selection becomes useful |
| `TO_SEARCH_PATH_FRAGMENTS` | `0` | Let plain words match anywhere in paths |
| `TO_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS` | `0` | Search through symlinked directory trees |
| `TO_ROOT_MODE` | `home` | `home` searches `$HOME` plus roots; `explicit` searches only configured roots |
| `TO_WATCH_DEBOUNCE` | `2` | Seconds to wait before watcher reindex |
| `TO_AUTOWATCH` | `0` | Start a background watcher when zsh integration loads |
| `TO_AUTO_ADD_ROOTS` | `0` | Add temporary-search parent roots after successful external jumps |
| `TO_AI_COMMAND` | empty | External command for `to ai <query...>` |
| `TO_AI_RANK_COMMAND` | empty | External command that ranks candidates from stdin |
| `TO_HELPER` | auto | Explicit path to `to-helper` |

Persistent state lives under `~/.config/to` by default:

```text
roots         configured search roots
index.sqlite3 SQLite dirs, tokens, aliases, workspaces, recent, root metadata
aliases       text fallback for aliases
workspaces    text fallback for workspaces
recent        text fallback for recent jumps
index.tsv     fallback directory index when sqlite3 is unavailable
```

Set `TO_CONFIG_HOME` before loading the plugin to use another config
directory:

```zsh
TO_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.local/state/to"
eval "$(to init zsh)"
```

Invalid numeric or boolean config values fall back to safe defaults instead of
breaking shell startup.

## Safety

`to` changes only shell state and files under `TO_CONFIG_HOME`. It does not
delete user directories. When cached paths become stale, `to` prunes those rows
from its own SQLite/TSV index and falls back to live filesystem search.

Path handling is quoted and tested with spaces and unicode. SQL queries quote
user input before passing it to SQLite.

`TO_AI_COMMAND` and `TO_AI_RANK_COMMAND` are explicit escape hatches for users
who want custom ranking. They are not sandboxed; configure them only with
commands you would be comfortable running directly in your shell.

## Performance

`to` does not run a background daemon by default. Idle cost is effectively
zero unless you opt in to watching.

Normal jumps are index-first:

```text
query -> SQLite -> validate path -> cd
                  -> fallback to fd/find on miss or stale path
                  -> write fresh result back to SQLite
```

Fallback search runs only inside the configured roots, never across the whole
filesystem by default. In home-first mode, a new directory anywhere under
`$HOME` is discoverable immediately:

```zsh
mkdir -p "$HOME/somewhere/new-service"
to new-service
```

That first jump writes the directory back to the index, so later queries can
resolve from SQLite without a live scan.

File-name jumps use the same roots and exclusions, but they scan file names on
demand instead of indexing every file. This keeps the SQLite database small and
avoids turning `to` into a full content indexer.

The SQLite index stores:

```sql
dirs(id, path, name, parent, depth, is_git, last_seen, last_used, hit_count)
tokens(token, dir_id)
roots(path, mtime, config_key, last_indexed)
aliases(name, path)
workspaces(name, path)
recent(path, last_used)
```

Successful jumps update `hit_count` and `last_used`, so ranking improves with
use. Results are ordered roughly as:

```text
exact name > recent/frequent > shallower depth > shorter path
```

`to --reindex` is incremental for SQLite. It records root mtime and
index-affecting config, skips unchanged roots, refreshes changed roots, adds
new directories, and prunes stale directories under refreshed roots.

Broader modes cost more:

- `to src/components` searches a path fragment.
- `to -i backend` collects all matches for selection.
- `TO_SEARCH_PATH_FRAGMENTS=1` lets single words match anywhere in a path.
- `to --watch` runs a foreground watcher and reindexes after filesystem events.

### Watching for changes

Run a watcher when you want the index kept warm automatically:

```zsh
to --watch
```

On macOS, install `fswatch`:

```zsh
brew install fswatch
```

On Linux, install `inotify-tools`:

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y inotify-tools
```

The watcher monitors configured roots, waits `TO_WATCH_DEBOUNCE` seconds after
an event, then runs incremental `to --reindex`. That adds new directories under
changed roots and prunes stale indexed directories.

To start the watcher automatically when `eval "$(to init zsh)"` loads the zsh
integration, set:

```zsh
TO_AUTOWATCH=1
```

`TO_AUTOWATCH` starts only when `fswatch` or `inotifywait` is available.

For lower energy use on large machines, prefer:

```zsh
TO_MAX_DEPTH=5
TO_SEARCH_PATH_FRAGMENTS=0
TO_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS=0
```

## Troubleshooting

Check the environment:

```zsh
to --doctor
```

Refresh the index:

```zsh
to --reindex
```

Confirm zsh integration:

```zsh
to init zsh
```

Force selection if the automatic choice is not what you want:

```zsh
to -i backend
```

Search one tree without changing saved roots:

```zsh
to -r /path/to/root backend
```

Avoid broad system roots. Prefer the narrowest directory that contains the
places you actually jump to:

```zsh
to use /path/to/root
```

If `to` finds too many matches, keep broad path search disabled:

```zsh
TO_SEARCH_PATH_FRAGMENTS=0
```

If `to` does not find a repository, check whether its parent directory is in
your roots:

```zsh
to roots
to use /path/that/contains/repos
to --reindex
```

If `to` is slow, check roots and reduce depth:

```zsh
to roots
TO_MAX_DEPTH=5
```
